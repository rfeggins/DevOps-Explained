## What are shell scripts
A shell is a command-line interpreter and typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.

A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by the Unix/Linux shell which could be one of the following:

- The Bourne Shell
- The C Shell
- The Korn Shell
- The GNU Bourne-Again Shell

## Shell Variables
Shell variables in Unix are a character string that the developer can be assigned a value.

The value assigned could be a number, text, filename, device, or any other type of data.

In fact, a variable is nothing more than a pointer to the actual data. The shell enables you to create, assign, and delete variables.

### Variable Names
The name of a variable can contain only letters (a to z or A to Z), numbers ( 0 to 9) or the underscore character ( _ ).

By convention, Unix shell variables will have their names in UPPERCASE.

The following examples are valid variable names −
