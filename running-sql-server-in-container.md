## Overview
SQL Server 2017 now runs on Linux. Itâ€™s the same SQL Server database engine, with many similar features and services regardless of your operating system. SQL Server 2017 can be installed and run on the following linux distributions :
- [Install on Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-red-hat?view=sql-server-2017)
- [Install on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-suse?view=sql-server-2017)
- [Install on Ubuntu](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-ubuntu?view=sql-server-2017)

In this blog, we will walk through the steps to pull and run the SQL Server 2017 using a docker container image. This image, mssql-server-linux, consists of SQL Server running on Linux based on Ubuntu 16.04 and can be used with the Docker Engine 1.8+ on Linux or on Docker for Mac/Windows.

With containers you can take advantage of the Container platform along with using CI/CD for both the application code but also for the run-time environment.

Here is a quick summary of what we will cover:
- Pulling the docker image for SQL Server from Docker github
- Running SQL Server instance in Docker
- Connnecting to the SQL instance
- Creating our first database

In a subsequent blog, we will then add this container to a Kubernetes cluster running on the IBM Container Service where we will then connect with sqlcmd to create your first database and run queries.

### Prerequisites

Here is the list of the following prerequisites required to complete this tutorial
-	Minimum of 4 GB of disk space
- Minimum of 4 GB of RAM
-	Docker Engine 1.8+ or [Docker for Mac/Windows](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

## Step 1 - Pulling SQL Server container
The official docker images for Microsoft SQL Server that can run on Linux are available here, the [mssql-server-linux Docker hub page.](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/mssql-server-linux/tags/)
For this lab will be using the SQL Server developer edition. The process for running production editions for SQL Server 2017 in containers is slightly different. For more information, see Run production container images.
1.	Pull SQL Server image (On some system sudo might not be required.)
>
> sudo docker pull microsoft/mssql-server-linux:2017-GA
>
2.	Note if you want to pul the latest image, you can change the tag name, for example you can use
> microsoft/mssql-server-linux:2017-latest


3.	Execute command docker images to see what other images you now have available locally
>
> sudo docker images
>

## Step 2 - Running SQL Server instance in Docker

4.	To run the container locally using Docker, you can use the following command from a bash shell (Linux/macOS)
>
> sudo docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=<YourStrong!Passw0rd>' \
>
> -p 1433:1433 --name sql1 \
>
> -d microsoft/mssql-server-linux:2017-GA

Note in some cases you may need to increase the memory size that you are using for Docker.
https://github.com/Microsoft/mssql-docker/issues/114

5. Check if docker image successfully started by running following commands
> sudo docker ps
>
> sudo docker ps -a


6. In my case the container running SQL-Server didn't start properly so I also had to check the error logs by executing the [docker logs command.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/)
>
> sudo docker logs --details <container-id>
>

If the STATUS column shows a status of Up, then SQL Server is running in the container and listening on the port specified in the PORTS column.

If the STATUS column for your SQL Server container shows Exited, then you will need to do some troubleshooting and retry again.

## Step 3 - Connecting to SQL Server
Once running, you can  connect to the SQL Server instance on your Docker machine either by accessing internally or from any external system that can supports SQL connections and can access the container.

The following steps uses the * sqlcmd * and assume that you already have the SQL Server command-line tools installed.   In this scenario the SQL Server command-line tool, sqlcmd, is inside the container to connect to SQL Server.

7.	Use the docker exec -it command to start an interactive bash shell inside your running container.
   > sudo docker exec -it sql1 "bash"

  Using the docker exec -it command to start an interactive bash shell inside your running container. You can use standard commands such as "ls", "cd". "pwd" to name a few.


8. Once you have access to the bash shell for your MS Server container, change to the sqlcmd directory as Sqlcmd is not in the path by default.
  > cd /opt/mssql-tools/bin/
  >
  > ./sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P '<YourNewStrong!Passw0rd>'


## Step 4 - Create a test data

   The following steps create a new database named **TestDB.**

1.	From the sqlcmd command prompt, paste the following Transact-SQL command to create a test database:

   > >    CREATE DATABASE TestDB

2.	On the next line, write a query to return the name of all of the databases on your server:

   > > SELECT Name from sys.Databases

3.	You may meed to type GO on a new line to execute the previous commands
   >> GO

4. Next create a new table, called "Inventory", and insert two new rows.


5. To exit the interactive command-prompt in your container, type exit. Your container continues to run after you exit the interactive bash shell.



## Summary

In this tutorial we covered walked through
- Pulling the docker image for SQL Server from Docker github
- Running SQL Server instance in Docker
- Connnecting to the SQL instance
- Creating our first database

If you want to remove the SQL Server container used in this tutorial, run the following commands:
>
>   sudo docker stop sql1
>

In an upcoming blog we will setup a persistent volume, create a kubernetes deployment file and deploy our SQL Server container to one or more cloud environments.
